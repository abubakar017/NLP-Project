# NLP-Project
This project leverages advanced techniques such as Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to enhance the effectiveness of vulnerability identification in C++ code. Traditional static and dynamic analysis techniques face challenges related to scalability and the identification of fine-grained vulnerabilities.
